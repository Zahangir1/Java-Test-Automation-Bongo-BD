# Java-Test-Automation-Bongo-BD
In this project I have automated www.bongobd.com application using Selenium and TestNG. Written 3 Test cases including opening the URL, Click and Load a movie/drama, And play the drama without any errors. And also I have written Unit tests and stored the results in Log file, Captured screenshots and generated the entire test repors in a HTML document. Page Object Model is used, hence I have created separate Page objects for front page and Drama page.
